#Urban Dictionary
The urban dictionary is a compilation of city
slangs. It is a simple project that demonstrates
the use of simple and basic programming concepts.

#Design

Classes
 - Dictionary: The main dictionary
 - DictionaryManager: The data access layer, responsible for
   performing CRUD operations on the dictionary.
 - RankWords: Returns a word count in descending order of
   words used in sample sentences in the dictionary

 The phpunit framework for testing is used to perform
